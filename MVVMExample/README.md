## Basic MVVM
This is a simple MVVM application that I created using John Shewchuk's developer's blog. The aim of this simple MVVM application is to further teach myself about
the MVVM design pattern in C# and how to create very responsive and modern applications for Universal Windows Platform using the MVVM design.
